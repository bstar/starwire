# The list is short, and that is the point rather than an oversight. There is no
# ffmpeg, no ALSA and no libdbus in this tree: SQLite is the amalgamation
# `rusqlite` bundles and TLS is rustls, and nothing runs bindgen. What is
# left is a C toolchain, because rustc still links with `cc`, and the things
# `git` and `rustup` need to fetch anything at all.
#
# If that changes -- a dependency picking up a `-sys` crate is the likely way --
# the library goes here, in flake.nix, and in the CI apt line, in one commit.
#
# Rust comes from rustup rather than apt: the MSRV is newer than anything
# bookworm or bullseye package, and the whole point of building in an old
# container is the old *glibc*, not an old toolchain.
