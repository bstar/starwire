# The AppImage. Build in Debian Bullseye to retain the supported glibc floor.
#
# What it carries is, today, nothing: this binary links the C runtime and
# libgcc and that is the whole of its NEEDED list, so the library walk below
# finds nothing worth bundling and the AppDir's usr/lib comes out empty. The
# walk is here anyway, because the first dependency that picks up a `-sys`
# crate should travel with the file rather than be discovered by somebody on
# another distribution.
#
# It is still the right artifact to ship. One file, executable, with its icon
# and its desktop entry inside it, built against a glibc old enough for
# everything still supported -- which is what makes "download it and run it"
# true without a package for each distribution.
#
# Assembled by hand rather than with linuxdeploy, because linuxdeploy ships as
# an AppImage and an AppImage cannot be executed inside a container without
# FUSE. Doing it directly is a dozen lines, needs nothing that has to run, and
# leaves the exclude list somewhere it can be read.

#   libgcc_s,        the host's is never older than bullseye's, and a bundled
#   libstdc++        old one is a real hazard on a newer host.
#
# Nothing else is on this list. There is no libasound here to argue about and
# no libav sonames to chase; the reason this file exists is the glibc floor,
# not a bundled decoder.
